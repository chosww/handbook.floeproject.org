    description: Consider the 3D printer limitations and characteristics and adjust the printing parameters to avoid imperfections.
---
- **Tip:** divide the digital model into several parts to be printed, if necessary.
- **Tip:** watch for possible imperfections that could be confused with textures or image components.
- **Tip:** post-process the 3D printing if necessary. The tactile surface must be safe for the person handling it. It
should be smooth to the touch, neither too rough nor too smooth, without sharp edges, non-flammable and non-harmful.
- **Examples:** maximum print size, available supplies and post-processing needs.
