# Asset Handling

The ILDH uses [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com) as a wrapper for webpack to process JavaScript and CSS,
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com) stylesheets.

## Scripts

By default, the Mix [configuration file](../../webpack.mix.js) includes configuration for processing the JavaScript
files that are found in the [`/src/assets/scripts`](scripts) directory. The processed JavaScript files will be written
to `/_site/assets/scripts`. Additional JavaScript files can be added to the Mix [configuration file](../../webpack.mix.js)
if desired. For example, if you want to add a new JavaScript file called `widget.js`, you can make the following change
to add it to Mix for processing:

```diff
// Process JavaScript files with Babel.
mix.js("./src/assets/scripts/app.js", "_site/assets/scripts");
mix.js("./src/assets/scripts/matomo.js", "_site/assets/scripts");
mix.js("./src/assets/scripts/uio.js", "_site/assets/scripts");
+ mix.js("./src/assets/scripts/widget.js", "_site/assets/scripts");
```

## Stylesheets

The Mix [configuration file](../../webpack.mix.js) includes configuration for processing the Sass stylesheet files that
are found in the [`/src/assets/styles`](styles) directory and its subdirectories following [the 7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern)
from the Sass Guidelines. The rules are organized using BEM, with some exceptions. The processed CSS file will be written
to `/_site/assets/styles`. Additional CSS files can be added to the Mix [configuration file](../../webpack.mix.js) if
desired. For example, if you want to add a new CSS file called `widget.css`, you can make the following change to add it
to Mix for processing:

```diff
// Process Sass stylesheets
mix.sass("./src/assets/styles/main.scss", "_site/assets/styles");
+ mix.sass("./src/assets/styles/widget.css", "_site/assets/styles");
```

## Eleventy Integration

Laravel Mix generates an asset manifest in JSON format (this example shows the assets with a [version string for cache
busting](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/versioning)):

```json
{
    "/scripts/app.js": "/scripts/app.js?id=f45bfe43b5e6cb80a6da",
    "/styles/main.css": "/styles/app.css?id=bc8ec84445a00d932c8a",
    "/scripts/matomo.js": "/scripts/matomo.js?id=3155c9bb3c237aa64c27",
    "/scripts/uio.js": "/scripts/uio.js?id=41d589185ccf95cc14f9"
}
```

The [`scripts.njk`](../_includes/partials/scripts.njk) and [`stylesheets.njk`](../_includes/partials/stylesheets.njk)
template partials use this asset manifest to load scripts and stylesheets in the site header. When running webpack and
Eleventy in watch mode (using `npm start`), a successful webpack build will update the asset manifest, triggering an
Eleventy build and refreshing the local development site with updated CSS and JavaScript assets.

If you wish to load different scripts or stylesheets on different pages, you will need to modify the
[`scripts.njk`](../_includes/partials/scripts.njk) and [`stylesheets.njk`](../_includes/partials/stylesheets.njk)
template partials to accomplish this.

## Advanced Methods

### Automatic Processing

The Mix [configuration file](../../webpack.mix.js) can be modified to automatically process all JavaScript, CSS, or
Sass files in the root of the [`/src/assets/scripts`](scripts) or [`/src/assets/styles`](styles) directory as
follows.

1. Add the [`fast-glob`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-glob) package to your devDependencies:

    ```bash
    npm i --save-dev --save-exact fast-glob
    ```

2. Require `fast-glob` in the Mix [configuration file](../../webpack.mix.js):

    ```diff
    const mix = require("laravel-mix");
    + const fg = require("fast-glob");
    const moveFile = require("move-file");
    ```

3. Replace the relevant section (for JavaScript, CSS and/or Sass â€” this example shows JavaScript):

    ```diff
    // Process JavaScript files with Babel.
    - mix.js("./src/assets/scripts/app.js", "_site/assets/scripts");
    - mix.js("./src/assets/scripts/matomo.js", "_site/assets/scripts");
    - mix.js("./src/assets/scripts/uio.js", "_site/assets/scripts");
    + const scriptPaths = fg.sync("./src/assets/scripts/*.js");
    +
    + scriptPaths.forEach(entryPath => {
    +     mix.js(entryPath, "_site/assets/scripts");
    + });
    ```

This technique [globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) all files of the specified type and then calls
the appropriate Mix function against each file in the resulting array.

#### Caveats

- This example configuration will only process files in the root of the [`/src/assets/scripts`](scripts) or
  [`/src/assets/styles`](styles) directories. If you need to process files in subdirectories (rather than importing them
  into the main files), this might not be the right approach for you.
- If you add a new JavaScript, CSS, or Sass file to the appropriate directory while Eleventy is running (after
  calling `npm run start`), the new file will not be processed immediately. You'll need to restart the build for the new
  file to be processed.

### Automatic Loading

The [`scripts.njk`](../_includes/partials/scripts.njk) and [`stylesheets.njk`](../_includes/partials/stylesheets.njk)
template partials can be modified to automatically load all JavaScript and CSS files from the asset manifest as follows.

1. Modify the [`scripts.njk`](../_includes/partials/scripts.njk) template partial to automatically load all JavaScript
   files listed in the asset manifest:

    ```diff
    - <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets{{ assets['/scripts/app.js'] }}" defer></script>
    - <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets{{ assets['/scripts/matomo.js'] }}" defer></script>
    + {% set jsPattern = r/.*\.js$/ %}
    + {% for key, value in assets %}
    + {% if jsPattern.test(key) %}
    + <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets{{ value }}" defer></script>
    + {% endif %}
    + {% endfor %}
    ```

2. Modify the [`stylesheets.njk`](../_includes/partials/stylesheets.njk) template partial to automatically load all CSS
   files listed in the asset manifest:

    ```diff
    - <link href="/assets{{ assets['/styles/app.css'] }}" rel="stylesheet" />
    + {% set cssPattern = r/.*\.css$/ %}
    + {% for key, value in assets %}
    + {% if cssPattern.test(key) %}
    + <link href="/assets{{ value }}" rel="stylesheet" />
    + {% endif %}
    + {% endfor %}
    ```

#### Caveats

If you need to selectively load some assets on some pages and not on others, this technique isn't suitable.
